If you feel that this is your case, the psychotherapist says that there's no set time frame for how long to wait before reaching out. "Only you can take your own emotional temperature," she says. "Feelings change from moment to moment. If it feels right, go for it." Just remember: The key to reaching out to an ex is to expect absolutely nothing.
